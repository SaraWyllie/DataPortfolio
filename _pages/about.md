I recently received my PhD in physics.  My graduate work was focused on quantum information and nonlinear optics. I worked extensively with Mathematica for theoretical research but also used Matlab, and Python for various projects, and contributed to machine learning projects in optical communication.  I've been exploring various areas that the skills I learned in my physics education can be applied.  This fostered an interest in data science.  Here I will be dislaying data projects that I work on as I seek to expand my coding abilities.
